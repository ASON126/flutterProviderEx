## help --
I am new to Flutter Dart Development ...

The following Repo is an example for Provider as State Management.

I have Created a logic , that is some of boiler plate so i would like if anyone can help me with other approaches .
In the Flutter - Provider Ex I have used provider as State Management library to increment the counter by tapping the Floating action button- additionally  I have also added the counter name to increment with counter as well.
